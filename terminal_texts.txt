Analyzing...

- Based on your file extension, your file is formatted as a CSV file
- Your file contains 73 prompt-completion pairs. In general, we recommend having at least a few hundred examples. We've found that performance tends to linearly increase for every doubling of the number of examples
- The completion should start with a whitespace character (` `). This tends to produce better results due to the tokenization we use. See https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/preparing-your-dataset for more details

Based on the analysis we will perform the following actions:
- [Necessary] Your format `CSV` will be converted to `JSONL`
- [Recommended] Add a whitespace character to the beginning of the completion [Y/n]: y


Your data will be written to a new JSONL file. Proceed [Y/n]: y

Wrote modified file to `training_data.jsonl`
Feel free to take a look!

Now use that file when fine-tuning:
> openai api fine_tunes.create -t "training_data.jsonl"


Once your model starts training, it'll approximately take 3.45 minutes to train a `curie` model, and less for `ada` and `babbage`. Queue will approximately take half an hour per job ahead of you.
